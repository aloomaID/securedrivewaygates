            <h3>Neptune Beach, FL Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Neptune Beach is a beachfront city east of Jacksonville in Duval County, Florida, United States. When the majority of Duval County communities consolidated with Jacksonville in 1968, Neptune Beach, along with Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach and Baldwin remained quasi-independent. Like those other towns, it maintains its own municipal government but its residents vote in the Jacksonville mayoral election and are represented on the Jacksonville city council. With a 2020 census population of 7,217, Neptune Beach is the smallest of the Jacksonville Beaches communities.</p>
